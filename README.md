# git-exercise-sp25

Welcome to Lab04's Git Exercise where you'll be exploring this repository. 

This short exercise is designed to teach you some basic git commands and concepts! 

In this assignment, you'll be tasked with finding three password pieces hidden throughout the repository. 

If you open "password.txt" as is, you won't find a password. Maybe... it's in a previous version of the file?
